Ludum Dare 27 post compo v2.0 game code.

The small game I made for Ludum Dare 27. Made with Impact, should run in any browser. WASD or arrow key to move.

You are a zombie. You need to get to the huge brain. You need to eat every 10 seconds. Stay away from the guards. If you die you can continue as one of the remaining zombies.
